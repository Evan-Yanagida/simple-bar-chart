# simple-bar-chart
A simple example of a bar chart in matplotlib.  It imitates a bar chart found in an iOS app called 'Sweatcoin' that displays the amount of steps walked.  Point of Interest: Adaptively centers the text for number of steps walked on the ends of each bar, regardless of variance in number of digits.
